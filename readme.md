## Help Hub
First capstone project at Thinkful

# Live Site
https://morettisf.github.io/help-hub/

# Background
Help Hub provides an easy way to find emergency locations in your area. Using a simple menu users are able to find nearby police departments, fire stations, hospitals, mental crisis facilities, and veterinary services. The app uses custom markers to help users easily see which location is being placed on the map. Help Hub is not a substitute for dialing 911 during an emergency. It is only meant for emergency preparedness.
